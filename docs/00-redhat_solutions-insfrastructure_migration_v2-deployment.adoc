== Infrastructure Migration v2 - Deployment Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

The field experience in migrating VMs from propietary virtualization infrastructures to Red Hat infrastructure providers has been completed in several customized engagements. From the experience of these engagements and with the involvement of Engineering and User Experience and Design teams, a productized version of it is built, and included in the environment provided for this guide.

This guide intends to provide the information needed to perform a successful deployment of the Infrastructure Migration solution.

[WARNING] 
This guide will not work properly in an environment previously used for the Infrastructure Migration Lab. A fresh new environment needs to be requested to follow this guide

== Requirements

What is needed to run the solution and, hopefully, why ... :-)

=== Product requirements

The minimum product versions required to run the solution are the following:
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Version
|CloudForms Nightly |4.6+ 
|Red Hat Virtualization |4.2.2+ beta
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Hypervisor) |7.5
|VMware vSphere |5.5+
|=======

=== CloudForms requirements

CloudForms is deployed using a Nightly Build appliance. To save time a pre-deployed appliance is provided

The CloudForms appliance will use:

* RHEL 7.5 
* Software Collections 
** PostgreSQL 9.5

=== RHV Requirements

Red Hat Virtualization, referred as RHV, is the product built from the code of its upstream project oVirt. 
To be able to perform the migration the following versions are required:

* RHEL 7.5 
* RHV 4.2.2+ beta

The code being included will reach the product once it's published as GA.

Meanwhile, the location of the packages used in this lab are the following:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Origin| Use
|RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ |RHEL 7.5.z beta builds (Libvirt changes needed)
|RHEL 7.5 optional |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server-optional/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 optional packages beta builds
|RHEL 7.5 extras |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-EXTRAS-7-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 extras packages beta builds
|RHV Hypervisor packages for RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/repos/rhevh-rhel-7.5-candidate/$basearch/ |RHV Hypervisor beta builds for RHEL 7.5
|RHV Manager 4.2.2 |http://bob.eng.lab.tlv.redhat.com/builds/4.2/rhv-4.2.2-3/el$releasever |RHV Manager 4.2.2 beta builds

|=======

The packages are already available "offline" in the environment in:

* http://storage.example.com/repos

The following https://github.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/blob/master/notes/rhv_infra_migration.repo[repo file] is used to consume the packages in the environment for the Manager, as well as for the Hypervisors, which are RHEL based.

=== Conversion Host Requirements

To perform the conversion task of the VMs during migration a conversion host is required. One of the architectural choices is to use RHEL-H Hypervisors as conversion hosts, which is the one we will use here.

== VM Migration Workflow

image::migration_workflow.png[VM Migration Workflow]

. The Infrastructure Admin creates an *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* for VM migration. The VM migration executes.

. CloudForms locates the *VMs* chosen to migrate based on the *Infrastructure Mapping* and source *ESXi hosts*.  

. The ESXi host *fingerprint* is captured for VM conversion. 

. Using the *RHV attributes* for the target environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the *RHV engine* and *API upload*.

. The *RHV API upload* selects a *conversion host* for the VM transformation. RHEL based RHV hosts must have the tools installed, and configured as *conversion hosts*.

. The *RHV conversion host* captures the *VM attributes* from the source using virt-v2v.

. The *target VM* is created.

. The *RHV conversion host* connects to the source *VM datastore* and streams the disk conversion to the *RHV data domain* (a.k.a. Storage Domain). A disk with the transformed VM is created.

. Once the disk creation is complete, the *disk is attached* to the *target VM*.

. *VM migration is complete* and status displayed in CloudForms.

For more detail please take a look at the link:images/migration_workflow_rhv.png[full detailed vm migration and conversion workflow for RHV] 

If you have doubts on the steps taking place during the conversion, please read the link:01-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-vm_conversion_faq.adoc[VM Conversion FAQ]

== Deployment

=== CloudForms Deployment

The environment, as instantiated, is fully configured. In a simulated deployment we will have a predeployed VMware vSphere virtualization environment, and a Red Hat Virtualization environment with, at least one hypervisor running RHEL. 

In this Deployment Lab, a Cloudforms appliance is already provided, so there is no need to deploy one.
As a reference on how to deploy a CloudForms appliace on RHV and vSphere the following official documentation is available: 

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on Red Hat Virtualization]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_vmware_vsphere/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on VMware vSphere]

In this lab we will have a CloudForms instance, that was deployed using a nightly build, by downloading an appliance image and adding it to the environment.

The environment is configured and an overview look at it is recommended before starting.

Once the overview is done, we can proceed by running, in `workstation`, the playbook to unconfigure the deployed CloudForms:

----
# cd /root/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook unconfigure.yml 
----

The playbook will stop the CloudForms services, will reset the database, and restart the services.

[NOTE]
Take into account that after CloudForms database reset, the users will be removed and the `admin` will have the password reset to the default appliance password.

==== Enable Git Repositories

Some logic to perform the VMs transformation is provided in a git repo.

To enable, in CloudForms, the capability to import git repos, the neccesary role has to be activated, by following these steps:

. Go to upper right corner, click in *Administrator* to get a drop down menu, and in it, click in *Configuration*.

. In the *Configuration* page click in *Git Repositories Owner* to enable it, and then click *Save*
+
image::cloudforms_enable_git.png[CloudForms Enable Git]

==== Add Virtualization Providers

Once CloudForms has been reset to a just installed state, the Virtualization providers have to be added to it. This can be done by following these steps:

. Navigate, in *Cloudforms* to  *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_1.png[Add Providers 1]

. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type in Name `VMware` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `VMware vCenter`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `vcenter.example.com`, in *Username* type `root` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_2.png[Add Providers 2]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_3.png[Add Providers 3]

. This will move to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "VMware" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_4.png[Add Providers 4]

. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider* again. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type, this time, Name `RHV` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `Red Hat Virtualization`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `rhvm.example.com`, deactivate *Verify TLS Certificates*, then in *Username* type `admin@internal` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_5.png[Add Providers 5]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_6.png[Add Providers 6]

. This will move, again, to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "RHV" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_7.png[Add Providers 7]

This way the two Virtualization provided are managed by CloudForms. Take some time to navigate the menues under *Compute -> Infrastructure*.

[TIP]
It is recommended to go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers* select both providers and clinck on *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States* before continuing to have all data from providers updated.

==== Adding the V2V Automation Domain

Some logic to perform the VMs transformation tasks come bundled as a Domain, provided by a git repo.

It requires that the *Git Repositories Owner* is enabled as states some steps above.

. To import the Domain, go to *Automation -> Automate -> Import/Export*.

. In the *Import/Export* page, in the field for *Git URL* type `https://github.com/RedHatDemos/v2v-automate.git`, no *Username* or *Password* needed. The checkbox *Verify Peer Certificate* may be left checked. Click *Submit*. (Alternative URL for git repo: `https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-automate.git`)
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_1.png[CloudForms Automate Import 1]
 
. A page to specify import details appears. In it the selection for *Branch/Tag* will be `Branch` and the selection in *Branches* will be `origin/master`. Click *Submit*.
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_2.png[CloudForms Automate Import 2]

. The import will be done and a page informing with the message *Imported from git* will appear.
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_3.png[CloudForms Automate Import 3]

. Import can be verified by navigating to *Automation -> Automate -> Explorer* and seeing the `V2V (origin/master) (V2V) (Locked)` entry in the *Datastore*

=== Conversion Host Installation

We will use both hypervisors, `kvm0` and `kvm1`, as conversion hosts. Host `kvm0` is already configured. We will proceed to install `kvm1`.

In the `/root` directory of the Worksation, used as *Ansible* main host, the following repo is cloned:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Directory |Origin| Use
|v2v-transformation_host-ansible |https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-transformation_host-ansible.git |Conversion Hosts Playbooks (Enable/Disable/Check)
|=======

The file `inventory_example.yml` is created, in the `v2v-transformation_host-ansible` directory, with the following content:

----
all:
  vars:
    v2v_repo_rpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_rpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_vddk_package_name: "VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
    v2v_vddk_package_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
  hosts:
#    kvm0.example.com:
    kvm1.example.com:
----

Then the playbooks are run in the `v2v-transformation_host-ansible` directory. 

There is a `check` playbook that can be run and ensures that the installation is OK. You can run it before install to see how it reports errors:

----
# cd /root/v2v-transformation_host-ansible
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory_example.yml transformation_host_check.yml 
----


After that, the installation of tools can be performed by running the `enable` playbook:

----
# cd /root/v2v-transformation_host-ansible
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory_example.yml transformation_host_enable.yml 
----

It may be time to check again and ensure the tool installation went OK:

----
# cd /root/v2v-transformation_host-ansible
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory_example.yml transformation_host_check.yml 
----

=== Conversion Host Configuration in CloudForms

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm1*.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Select *V2V - Transformation Host* and then select *t* (as true) for the assigned value.
+
image::conversion_host_4.png[Conversion Host 4]
+
image::conversion_host_5.png[Conversion Host 5]
+
* This sets this Host as *Conversion Host*.

. Select the *V2V - Transformation Method* tag and select *VDDK* for the assigned value, then click *Save*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This sets the method that *Conversion Host* will use to migrate the *VMs*.
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]
+
[NOTE]
You may see the tags added under *Smart Management* in the host page.

. On the `cf` system, go back to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm1* again.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item*.
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Fill *Username* with `root` and *Password* with the provided one. Click *Validate*. Once the message "Credential validation was successful" appears click *Save*. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. Now the conversion host is ready.
