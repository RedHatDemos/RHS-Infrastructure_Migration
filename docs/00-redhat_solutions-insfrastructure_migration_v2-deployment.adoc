== Infrastructure Migration v2 - Deployment Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

The field experience in migrating VMs from propietary virtualization infrastructures to Red Hat infrastructure providers has been completed in several customized engagements. From the experience of these engagements and with the involvement of Engineering and User Experience and Design teams, a productized version of it is built, and included in the environment provided for this guide.

This guide intends to provide the information needed to perform a successful deployment of the Infrastructure Migration solution.

== Requirements

What is needed to run the solution and, hopefully, why ... :-)

=== Product requirements

The minimum product versions required to run the solution are the following:
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Version
|ManageIQ Nightly |4.6+ (CloudForms in the future)
|Red Hat Virtualization |4.2.2+ beta
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Hypervisor) |7.5 beta
|VMware vSphere |5.5+
|=======

=== ManageIQ requirements

CloudForms is the product built from the code of its upstream project ManageIQ. There will be references to ManageIQ as the place where the changes are performed to get them into the product. 

Initially ManageIQ will be deployed using the following appliance:
http://manageiq.org/download/[Nightly]

To save time a pre-deployed appliance is provided

The ManageIQ appliance will use:

* RHEL 7.4 
* Software Collections 
** PostgreSQL 9.5

=== RHV Requirements

Red Hat Virtualization, referred as RHV, is the product built from the code of its upstream project oVirt. 
To be able to perform the migration the following versions are required:

* RHEL 7.5 beta
* RHV 4.2.2+ beta

The code being included will reach the product once it's published as GA.

Meanwhile, the location of the packages used in this lab are the following:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Origin| Use
|RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ |RHEL 7.5.z beta builds (Libvirt changes needed)
|RHEL 7.5 optional |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server-optional/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 optional packages beta builds
|RHEL 7.5 extras |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-EXTRAS-7-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 extras packages beta builds
|RHV Hypervisor packages for RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/repos/rhevh-rhel-7.5-candidate/$basearch/ |RHV Hypervisor beta builds for RHEL 7.5
|RHV Manager 4.2.2 |http://bob.eng.lab.tlv.redhat.com/builds/4.2/rhv-4.2.2-3/el$releasever |RHV Manager 4.2.2 beta builds
|JBoss EAP 7.1 |http://download.devel.redhat.com/devel/candidates/JBEAP/composing/latest-JBEAP-7.1-RHEL-7/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ |RHV Manager depends on it
|=======

The packages are already available "offline" in the environment in:

* http://storage.example.com/repos

The following https://github.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/blob/master/notes/rhv_infra_migration.repo[repo file] is used to consume the packages in the environment for the Manager, as well as for the Hypervisors, which are RHEL based.

=== Conversion Host Requirements

To perform the conversion task of the VMs during migration a conversion host is required. One of the architectural choices is to use RHEL-H Hypervisors as conversion hosts, which is the one we will use here.

== VM Migration Workflow

image::migration_workflow.png[VM Migration Workflow]

. The Infrastructure Admin creates an *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* for VM migration. The VM migration executes.

. CloudForms locates the *VMs* chosen to migrate based on the *Infrastructure Mapping* and source *ESXi hosts*.  

. The ESXi host *fingerprint* is captured for VM conversion. 

. Using the *RHV attributes* for the target environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the *RHV engine* and *API upload*.

. The *RHV API upload* selects a *conversion host* for the VM transformation. RHEL based RHV hosts must have the tools installed, and configured as *conversion hosts*.

. The *RHV conversion host* captures the *VM attributes* from the source using virt-v2v.

. The *target VM* is created.

. The *RHV conversion host* connects to the source *VM datastore* and streams the disk conversion to the *RHV data domain* (a.k.a. Storage Domain). A disk with the transformed VM is created.

. Once the disk creation is complete, the *disk is attached* to the *target VM*.

. *VM migration is complete* and status displayed in CloudForms.

For more detail please take a look at the link:images/migration_workflow_rhv.png[full detailed vm migration and conversion workflow for RHV] 

If you have doubts on the steps taking place during the conversion, please read the link:01-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-vm_conversion_faq.adoc[VM Conversion FAQ]

== Deployment

=== ManageIQ Deployment

The environment, as instantiated, is fully configured. In a simulated deployment we will have a predeployed VMware vSphere virtualization environment, and a Red Hat Virtualization environment with, at least one hypervisor running RHEL. 

A CloudForms appliance has to be deployed. To do so, follow the official documentation: 

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on Red Hat Virtualization]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_vmware_vsphere/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on VMware vSphere]

In this lab we will have a ManageIQ instance, that was deployed using a link:http://manageiq.org/download/[nightly build], by downloading an appliance image and adding it to the environment.

The environment is configured and an overview look at it is recommended before starting.

Once the overview is done, we can proceed by running the playbook to unconfigure the deplyed CloudForms / ManageIQ:

----
# cd /root/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook unconfigure.yml 
----

The playbook will stop the CloudForms services, will reset the database, and restart the services.

[NOTE]
Take into account that after CloudForms database reset, the users will be removed and the `admin` will have the password reset to the default appliance password.

==== Add Virtualization Providers

Once CloudForms has been reset to a just installed state, the Virtualization providers have to be added to it. This can be done by following these steps:

. Navigate, in *Cloudforms* to  *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_1.png[Add Providers 1]

. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type in Name `VMware` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `VMware vCenter`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `vcenter.example.com`, in *Username* type `root` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_2.png[Add Providers 2]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_3.png[Add Providers 3]

. This will move to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "VMware" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_4.png[Add Providers 4]

. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider* again. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type, this time, Name `RHV` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `Red Hat Virtualization`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `rhvm.example.com`, deactivate *Verify TLS Certificates*, then in *Username* type `admin@internal` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_5.png[Add Providers 5]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_6.png[Add Providers 6]

. This will move, again, to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "RHV" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_7.png[Add Providers 7]

This way the two Virtualization provided are managed by CloudForms. Take some time to navigate the menues under *Compute -> Infrastructure*.

==== Adding the V2V Automation Domain

Some logic to perform the VMs transformation tasks come bundled as a Domain provided by a git repo.

To enable, in CloudForms, the capability to import git repos, the neccesary role has to be activated, by following these steps:

. Go to upper right corner, click in *Administrator* to get a drop down menu, and in it, click in *Configuration*.

. In the *Configuration* page click in *Git Repositories Owner* to enable it, and then click *Save*
+
image::cloudforms_enable_git.png[CloudForms Enable Git]

. To import the Domain, go to *Automation -> Automate -> Import/Export*.

. In the *Import/Export* page, in the field for *Git URL* type `https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-automate.git`, no *Username* or *Password* needed. The checkbox *Verify Peer Certificate* may be left checked. Click *Submit*.
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_1.png[CloudForms Automate Import 1]
 
. A page to speccify import details appears. In it the selection for *Branch/Tag* will be `Branch` and the selection in *Branches* will be `origin/master`. Click *Submit*.
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_2.png[CloudForms Automate Import 2]

. The import will be done and a page informing with the message *Imported from git* will appear.
+
image::cloudforms_automate_import_3.png[CloudForms Automate Import 3]

. Import can be verified by navigating to *Automation -> Automate -> Explorer* and seeing the `V2V (origin/master) (V2V) (Locked)` entry in the *Datastore*

=== Conversion Host Installation

We will use both hypervisors, `kvm0` and `kvm1`, as conversion hosts. Host `kvm0` is already configured. We will proceed to install `kvm1`.

In the `root` folder of the Worksation, used as *Ansible* main host, the following repo is cloned:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Folder |Origin| Use
|manageiq |https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-transformation_host-ansible.git |Main ManageIQ backend code (CloudForms Upstream)
|=======

The file `inventory_example.yml` is created, in the `v2v-transformation_host-ansible` folder, with the following content:

----
all:
  vars:
    v2v_repo_rpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_rpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_vddk_package_name: "VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
    v2v_vddk_package_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
  hosts:
#    kvm0.example.com:
    kvm1.example.com:
----

Then the playbooks are run in the `v2v-transformation_host-ansible` folder. To check:

----
# cd /root/v2v-transformation_host-ansible
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory_example.yml transformation_host_check.yml 
----

After that, and if it all went OK, the installation:

----
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory_example.yml transformation_host_enable.yml 
----

=== Conversion Host Configuration in CloudForms

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm1*.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Select *V2V - Transformation Host* and then select *t* (as true) for the assigned value.
+
image::conversion_host_4.png[Conversion Host 4]
+
image::conversion_host_5.png[Conversion Host 5]
+
* This sets this Host as *Conversion Host*.

. Select the *V2V - Transformation Method* tag and select *VDDK* for the assigned value, then click *Save*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This sets the method that *Conversion Host* will use to migrate the *VMs*.
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]
+
[NOTE]
You may see the tags added under *Smart Management* in the host page.

. On the `cf` system, go back to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm1* again.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item*.
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Fill *Username* with `root` and *Password* with the provided one. Click *Validate*. Once the message "Credential validation was successful" appears click *Save*. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. Now the conversion host is ready.

The environment is ready to perform a migration. To test it, follow the link:00-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-lab.adoc[Lab Instructions].

== Advanced and Experimental
[NOTE]
Before proceeding with customization, export the automate domains from MiQ/CloudForms.

=== Customizing the Migration Workflow 

In this part of the training you will customize the migration workflow to perform extra steps.

Pick one of the following use-case:

. (easy) Modify automate to add a step in your statemachine to .... (tbd) 
. (medium) Ansible pre-migration step:   Use ansible to add the VM name to a log file (tracking VM migrations)
. (hard - bonus point) : Change CPU or Memory configuration of a VM after migration using Ansible or Automate.


== Troubleshooting the Migration Solution

=== Network Communication
. If network communication is severed between the source and target providers during migration, the migration will fail.  If the VM migration has begun import into the export domain in RHV, the faile dmigration will need to be cleaned up before attempting migration post failure.

=== Logs 
. The conversion log is stored in /tmp on conversion host.
+
[NOTE]
On earlier conversion host configurations, logs can be found in /var/log/vdsm/import/
+
. On the MiQ/CloudForms appliance, logs are located under /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log

=== Processes
. Infrastructure Migration uses virt-v2v to perform VM migrations from source to target.  This process runs on the RHV conversion host and is part of virt-v2v-wrapper.py.  https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/blob/master/files/virt-v2v-wrapper.py

.. The launch of virt-v2v-wrapper.py is done through SSH, directly from CloudForms, using the net-ssh gem. The wrapper input is passed as standard input through the SSH channel and the output is collected. The wrapper immediately returns, so the SSH connection is short and less prone to network issues.

.. Currently, CloudForms leverages the host credentials, that have to be provided through the WebUI: Infrastructure > Hosts > Configuration > Edit this host. These credentials are used to initiate the SSH channel. We use the root user account, as it is required to run the wrapper.

=== Common Failures
. Incorrect infrastructure mappings
. RHV host credentials not set in MiQ/CloudForms
. Incorrect attributes for import .csv file
