== Red Hat Solutions: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration

== Update CloudForms

This document describes how to update Cloudforms in the Ravello Blueprint for Infrastructure Migration Solution using nightly build images.

=== Download CloudForms Nightly

To obtain the CloudForms Nightly build we access the internal engineering builds.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Version | URL
|CloudForms Nightly |4.6+ | http://file.cloudforms.lab.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/builds/cfme/5.10/latest/
|=======

It is possible to update it to the upstream ManageIQ builds also by using the available URL

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Version | URL
|ManageIQ Nightly |Gaprindashvili | http://manageiq.org/download/
|=======

Ravello consumes vSphere images easily, therefore we will download the *CFME vSphere* image (with paravirtual drivers where possible).

[NOTE]
One example of the images used successcuflly in Ravello blueprints is this one:
http://file.cloudforms.lab.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/builds/cfme/5.10/20180521_152405/cfme-vsphere-paravirtual-5.10.0.0-nightly-20180521152405-1.x86_64.vsphere.ova

=== Upload CloudForms image to Ravello

To upload the image to Ravello from our Fedora workstation the following steps can be followed:

* Lets create a working directory
+
----
$ mkdir ravello
----

* And a directory for the images
+
----
$ mkdir ravello/images
----

* Download the link:http://cloud.ravellosystems.com/static/pages/import-tool/import-tool-download-page.html[Ravello Import Tool] 
+
image::ravello_import_tool.png[Ravello Import Tool]


* Uncompress it to our working directory. The folder *ravello_cli* will be created with the tools to upload images.
+
----
$ cd ravello
$ tar zxvf ~/Downloads/ravello_linux.tar.gz 
$ ls
ravello_cli  README 
----

* Rename the image with the prefix *GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV* and move it to the images folder
+
----
$ mv ~/Downloads/cfme-vsphere-paravirtual-5.10.0.0-nightly-20180521152405-1.x86_64.vsphere.ova images/GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-cfme-vsphere-paravirtual-5.10.0.0-nightly-20180521152405-1.x86_64.vsphere.ova
----
+
[NOTE]
It is very important to have the right prefix for the image as the permissions in Ravello are granted based on it. Without the proper prefix the image will not upload.

* Upload the image using your credentials
+
----
./ravello_cli/ravello import images/GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-cfme-vsphere-paravirtual-5.10.0.0-nightly-20180423143942-1.x86_64.vsphere.ova  -u <your_ravello_username>@redhat.com

Remember to use your own Ravello username to upload. The password will be prompted.

=== Creating New Blueprint in Ravello

To update the CloudForms instance in Ravello several steps need to be taken. To summarize it, we will create a new application from the previous blueprint, before publishing it we will add the uploaded VM, we will save the disk of the uploaded VM and use it to replace the one in the old CloudForms VM, and them remove the added VM. This way we won't need to reconfigure network addresses nor DNS names.

Let's go through the preocess step by step.

* Login in Ravello. https://cloud.ravellosystems.com
+
image::ravello_login.png[Ravello Login]
+
[NOTE] 
If you don't have a login to Ravello, you may read these link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1138617[Instructions] to request it.

==== Importing Uploaded VM

Once in Ravello we will import the previously uploaded VM, which contains the CloudForms Nightly build. (olr ManageIQ Nightly Build)

* Navigate to *Library -> VMs* and find the uploaded VM.  Once selected click on *Edit & Verify VM*.+
image:ravello_import_vm_1.png[Ravello Import VM 1]
+
[NOTE]
Our uploaded VM shows a gears icon because it was not fully imported, and the name is the one described in the OVA file.

* In the *General Properties* pane on the right, establish the VM name referencing its version, and add the build version to the description. Then click *finish*
image:ravello_import_vm_2.png[Ravello Import VM 2]
+
[NOTE]
In Nightly Builds the references to the version can be the date of the build in ISO 8601 format (or similar) to avoid confusion.

* The VM list will show now the image, marked as verified, with the version number in the name
+
image:ravello_import_vm_3.png[Ravello Import VM 3]

==== Update Blueprint

To update a blueprint, it has to be done in two steps. On step one we create an *application* that can be modified. On step two, once we have the modified application, we create a *blueprint* from it.

* Navigate to *Library -> Blueprints* and find the blueprint to be updated. In this case *GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-infra_migration_beta_testing*.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_1.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 1]

* Open the blueprint. Click on *Create Application*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_2.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 2]

* Choose the name of application, in this case *GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-infra_migration_beta_testing-update_nightly* and click *create*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_2.1.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 2.1]

* Before publising the application we will modify the CloudForms VM. Click on the *+* button in the upper left corner and drag and drop the VM that we improted previously
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_3.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 3]
+
[NOTE]
In this example the Imported VM name is GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-cfme-20180521.ova
 
* With the newly added VM selected, click on the *Disks* tab in the properties box on the right side of the screen. On the only disk in the tab click on *Save Disk to Library*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_4.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 4]

* Select the name for the disk. In this case we use *GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-cfme-20180521. Hard Disk 0*. Then click *Create*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_5.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 5]

* Once the disk is saved to library we get rid of the newly added VM. On the Lower right corner of the properties pane, click on *More* and then *Delete*. Then Click on *Delete* in te confirmation dialogue.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_6.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 6]
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_7.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 7]

* Now it's time to macke changes tothe CloudForms VM. We *select it* and in the properties pane on the right, we click on *disks*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_8.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 8]

* We delete both disks in the VM (all of them) by clickin on the *trashcan icon* in the upper right corner of each of them. The result is the following.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_9.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 9]

* We navigate in the properties pane, in the disks tab to *+Add -> Add Disk Based on Image*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_10.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 10]

* We search for the disk we created before *GLOBAL-SYSENG-DEV-cfme-20180521. Hard Disk 0*, choose it and click *Select*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_11.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 11]

* Once added, rename it to *root*, change the *Controller* to *VirtIO*, ensure it is *bootable*, and that *Skip CD boot* is selected.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_12.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 12]

* We navigate again in the properties pane, in the disks tab to *+Add -> Add Disk* to add a second disk (for the database)
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_13.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 13]

* Once added, rename it to *db* and change the *Controller* to *VirtIO*. Then click on *Save*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_14.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 14]

* Now we have the the CloudForms VM with an updated system disk and a second disk for the database. We click on the *Publish* button at the top to create the app.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_15.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 15]

* In the options dialog for publishing we select Optimize for *Performance*, and Location *US Southwest 1*. Then click *Publish*
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_16.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 16]

* The new application is published and will get started. We will access it through the IP of the Workstation, to find it out select the Workstation VM and the Summary tab.
+
image:ravello_blueprint_update_16.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 16]

==== Configuring the New CloudForms instance

We have now a just deployed CludForms instance. As the network configuration is provided via DHCP, the hostname and IP are coherent with other documentation. We need to do the initial configuration. To do so, follow these staps.

* Get Workstation public IP in Ravello by clicking in the *Summary* tab in the *Properties* pane
+
image:ravello_workstation_ip.png[Ravello Blueprint Update 16]

* SSH into workstation using the Lab password.
