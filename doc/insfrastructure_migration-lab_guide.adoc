== Infrastructure Migration 1.0 - Lab Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

This Lab Environment uses Red Hat CloudForms, and the Infrastructure Migration plugin (a.k.a. v2v-plugin), as a broker to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization. 

Please watch this videos for an introduction: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh018-virtualization-and-infrastructure-migration-technical-overview[Virtualization and Infrastructure Migration Technical Overview (RH018)]

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here]

In this environment the following configuration steps are already done:

* Configure the conversion hosts in the target provider (RHV)
* Provide credentials for virtualization providers and conversion hosts in CloudForms
* Assign tags for the conversion hosts in CloudForms
* CSV file created for the chosen VMs to be migrated

The providers are:

* Source - VMware vSphere
* Target - Red Hat Virtualization

After this initial step, the resource equivalence between the two providers has to be defined in an *Infrastucture Mapping* including:

* Clusters
* Storage Domains
* Networks

To perform the migration one *Conversion Host* has beeen configured. In this case RHEL hypervisors were used as conversion hosts.

Finally, a *Migration Plan* has to be executed to perform the final migration.

.Goal
* Migrate several VMs from vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization, using Red Hat CloudForms as a broker, with a Red Hat Solution: Infrastructure Migration
+
NOTE: The source VMs are still maintained post migration and are not deleted. This allows for "failback" if a migration failure occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It takes about 20 ~ 25 minutes for the demo to load completely and become accessible.
** Wait for the full demo to load, even if some of its systems are marked "Up."
* Watch for an email with information about how to access your demo environment.
** Make note of the email's contents: a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID.
** Whenever you see <YOUR-GUID> in the demo instructions, replace it with the GUID provided in the email.
* You can get real-time updates and status of your demo environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status.
====

[TIP]
Be mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take several hours to complete the demo, so you may need to extend the runtime. This is especially important in later steps when you are building virtual machines. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime, see https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle.

=== Environment

A full new demo environment is deployed on every request. To make the environment unique a 4 character identifier is assigned to it (i.e. `1e37`), this identifier is referred in this documentation as *YOUR-GUID*.  

The demo environment consists of the following systems:

|`vcenter.example.com` |`192.168.0.50` | vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com |VMware vCenter server
|=======

.Prerequisites

* Deployment of the demo environment which includes the following VMs provisioned in the vSphere environment:
** `jboss0` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `jboss1` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `lb` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running Nginx configured to proxy traffic to `jboss0` and `jboss1`
** `db` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running PostgreSQL that the `jboss0` and `jboss1` application servers connect to

* An external service is configured as https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com pointing to the Load Balancer to make the Ticket Monster app accesible.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1e37', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1e37.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the environment using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM jboss0.example.com:
+
----
jboss0.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with Nginx as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----
+ 
To check the infrastructure machines the followinf command can be also used:
+
----
# ansible infra -m ping
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhvm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.
+
image::rhv_login.png[RHV Login]

.. Verify that the Cluster is up and Hypervisors are active
+
[TIP]
As this is nested virtualization, sometimes the CPU type of the hypervisor is changed. 
+
image::rhv_hypervisors_up.png[RHV Hypervisors up]

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::vsphere_web_client_0.png[vCenter Login]

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You may need to enable it for this page. Here are the link:01-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-enable_flash.adoc[instructions to enable Adobe Flash]

* Click on *Log in to vSphere Web Client*
+

=== Validate the Current Infrastructure in CloudForms

. On the CloudForms web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_1.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_2.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_3.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 3]
+
[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *VMware* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]

=== Check Conversion Hosts

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm0*.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Check that *V2V - Transformation Host* has value *t* (for true) and that *V2V - Transformation Method* tag has value *VDDK*. Click *Cancel*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This values can also be seen in the *Smart Management* box in the host description
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item* (back in `kvm0`).
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Check that *Username* has `root` and Password is set. You can click *Validate* to verify they are OK then the message "Credential validation was successful" will appear. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. The conversion host is ready.


=== Create an Infrastructure Mapping

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type the name `ticket-monster-mapping` and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Clusters*, select *Source Cluster* as `vSphere\DC01\Cluster01` and *Target Cluster* as `RHV\CoolDataCenter\TrustedCluster` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Datastores*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Datastore* as `vSphere\Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `RHV\VMStorageNFS` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Network* as `vSphere\VMNetwork` and *Target Network* as `RHV\ovirtmgmt` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-mapping have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]

In these steps an *Infrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.

=== Create an Migration Plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Overview*, which is the finishing page from previous step.

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-mapping`, add the name `ticket-monster-plan-lb` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
[NOTE]
Keeping the default option will take us to the VM menu selector. For massive conversions a CSV file upload can be the right choice.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *lb* virtual machine, as the one to be migrated.
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
VM selector has a filter to help find a set of VMs within a long list.

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed during the migration. We won't use this in this demo. Click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Save migration plan to run later*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The migration plan can be run immediately, by choosing the other option. 

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan has been saved` shall appear. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Back to the migration paage we will see how the *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* are ready to be run
+
image::migration_plan_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

=== Launch Migration

. CloudForms interface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. Now the migration is executing. We can see the orchestration process in Cloudforms logs
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
And each VM migration process in the Conversion Host:
+
----
# ssh kvm0.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/vdsm/import/*
----

. CloudForms interface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. In RHV interface we can see starting to appear
+
image::migration_running_2.png[Migration Running 2]

. Migration finishes
+
image::migration_running_3.png[Migration Running 3]

. Let's check if the VMs are up and running using the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. It's time to check the *app* running and accesible via the URL https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
+
