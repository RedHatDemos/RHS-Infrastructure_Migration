== Infrastructure Migration 1.1 GA - Migration Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

This Lab Environment uses Red Hat CloudForms, and the Infrastructure Migration plugin (a.k.a. v2v-plugin) included with it, as a broker to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (OSP).

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here]

In this environment the following configuration steps are already done:

* Configure the conversion hosts in the target providers (RHV and OSP)
* Provide credentials for virtualization providers and conversion hosts in CloudForms
* Assign tags for the conversion hosts in CloudForms
* Configured Ansible hosts file in `workstation` and ssh keys exchanged (`/root/.ssh/id_rsa`)

The providers are:

* Source - VMware vSphere
* Targets - Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform

After this initial step, the resource equivalence between the two providers, involved in each migration, has to be defined in an *Infrastucture Mapping* including:

* Clusters
* Storage Domains
* Networks

To perform the migration one *Conversion Host* has been configured for each target provider (RHV / OSP).

* In the RHV case the one of the RHEL hypervisors is configured as conversion host
* In the OSP case an instance running in the `conversion` project is configured as conversion host

Finally, a *Migration Plan* has to be executed to perform the final migration.

.Goal
* Migrate several VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms as a broker, with the tooling included in the Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution
+
NOTE: The source VMs are not deleted, only powered off once the migration is done. This measure can also be used as "rollback" in case a migration failure occurs.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using the private SSH key of `lab-user`.

+
----
$ ssh lab-user@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the whole environment, from the `workstation`, using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers).
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up.
This is an example of a success message for the VM `cf.example.com`:
+
----
cf.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+
To check the infrastructure machines the following command can be also used:
+
----
# ansible infra -m ping
----
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with JBoss Core Services' Apache HTTP + modcluster as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP 7 in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----
+
[NOTE]
As this environment is quite big, and it is generated and powered up for you in a cloud environment, some resources may suffer from issues or delays depending on the status of the cloud. You may need to manually start up or reboot some of them. Please review everything is running before proceeding forward.

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]
+
If the ticketmonster app is not running, you may run the following command in `workstation`:
+
----
# start_vms
----

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
[TIP]
The password `to_be_provided` is the same one previously specified

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhvm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.
+
image::rhv_login.png[RHV Login]

.. Verify that the Cluster is up and Hypervisors are active
+
[TIP]
As this is nested virtualization, sometimes the CPU type of the hypervisor is changed.
+
image::rhv_hypervisors_up.png[RHV Hypervisors up]

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::vsphere_web_client_0.png[vCenter Login]

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You  need to enable it to access and use the web manager interface in vSphere 5.5.

* Click on *Log in to vSphere Web Client*
+
image::vsphere_web_client_1.png[vSphere Web Client Login]
+
[WARNING]
Use `root` as the username to log in to vCenter.

* Click *Click on VMs and Templates*.
+
image::vsphere_web_client_2.png[vCenter]

.. Click *VMs and Templates* and verify that the 4 VMs `lb.example.com`, `jboss0.example.com`, `jboss1.example.com` and `db.example.com` are running.
+
image::vsphere_web_client_3.png[vCenter]

* *CloudForms:* `https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::cloudforms_login.png[CloudForms Login]
+

After logging in you will be presented with the CloudForms Dashboard.
+
image::cloudforms_dashboard.png[CloudForms Dashboard]


* *OpenStack Horizon:* `http://horizon-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::horizon_login.png[Horizon Login]

=== Validate the Current Infrastructure in CloudForms

. Log in with user `admin` and the provided password in CloudForms. Once in the web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_1.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_2.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_3.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 3]
+

. To have proper information on all the resources available, check the provider's box, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_4.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 4]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_5.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 5]

. Time to go to *Compute -> Clouds -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_1.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in the provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_2.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_3.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 3]

. To have proper information on all the resources available, check the provider's box, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_4.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 4]
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_5.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 5]

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs & Templates*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *vSphere* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]
+
[TIP]
This is a good way to check that the app VMs are up and running and start the stopped ones.


== Create an Infrastructure Mapping (vSphere to RHV)

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration -> Infrastructure Mappings*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type the name `ticket-monster-map-rhv`, select as *Target Provider* `Red Hat Virtualization`  and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Map Compute*, select *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* as `vSphere\DC01\Cluster01` and *Target Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* as `RHV\CoolDataCenter\TrustedCluster` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Map Storage*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* as `vSphere\DC01\Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `RHV\VMStorageNFS` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Map Networks*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with. We will start by mapping the network used by VMs to connect to each other (i.e. JBoss EAP to the Database). We select *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* as `vSphere\DC01\App-Internal-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `RHV\service` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6a.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* We will continue by mapping the network used by VMs to expose services to the internet(i.e. the Load Balancer exposing the Ticket Monster app). We select *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* as `vSphere\DC01\App-DMZ-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `RHV\service-dmz` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6b.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* Finally we can map the management network. To do so, select *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* as `vSphere\DC01\Management Network` and *Target Network* as `RHV\ovirtmgmt` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-map-rhv have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_8.png[Infrastructure Mapping 8]

In these steps an *Infrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.

== Migrating VMs to RHV with a Migration Plan

=== Create the migration plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Migration Plans*.
+
image::migration_plan_0.png[Migration Plan 0]

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select in the drop down menu the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-rhv`, add the name `ticket-monster-plan-app` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
[NOTE]
Keeping the default option will take us to the VM menu selector. For massive conversions a CSV file upload can be the right choice.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *jboss0* and *jboss1*  virtual machines, as the ones to be migrated.
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
VM selector has a filter to help find a set of VMs within a long list. We may try filtering by the term `jboss`.

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed during the migration. We will do this in a later part of the lab. For now, click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Save migration plan to run later*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The migration plan can be run immediately, by choosing the other option.

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan-app has been saved` shall appear. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Back to the migration page we will see how the *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* are ready to be run
+
image::migration_plan_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

=== Launch Migration

. To launch the migration, while in the *Compute -> Migration* page, click on the *Migrate* button in the *ticket-monster-plan-app*.
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. The migration will get initiated. All data is gathered and preflight checks are executed.
+
image::migration_running_2.png[Migration Running 2]

. The plan gets auto-approved. Migration starts
+
image::migration_running_3.png[Migration Running 3]

. Now the migration is executing. It takes some time for the pre-migration steps to be finished and the conversion process to start.
We can see the orchestration process in CloudForms logs
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
Once the pre-migration steps are finished and the conversion starts, each VM conversion process can be tracked in the Conversion Host:
+
----
# ssh kvm1.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/vdsm/import/v2v-import-*
----

. CloudForms Migration interface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_4.png[Migration Running 4]

. Clicking on the running plan info box will display the detailed info of the status
+
image::migration_running_5.png[Migration Running 5]

. Progress can be followed in this page
+
image::migration_running_6.png[Migration Running 6]

. For the time of the migration the JBoss EAP servers, `jboss0` and `jboss1` will be powered off in `vSphere`, migrated and then powered on in `RHV`.
+
image::migration_running_7.png[Migration Running 7]

. It is possible to check in *RHV* interface, in *Compute -> Virtual Machines* how the VM gets imported.
+
image::migration_running_8.png[Migration Running 8]

. Once the migration is finishing ...
+
image::migration_running_9.png[Migration Running 9]

. ... the VMs get powered up
+
image::migration_running_10.png[Migration Running 10]
+
image::migration_running_11.png[Migration Running 11]

. The migration gets completed.
+
image::migration_running_12.png[Migration Running 12]

. Let's check if the VMs are up and running using the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. It's time to check the *app* running and accesible via the URL https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
+
image::migration_running_14.png[Migration Running 14]

. Migration can be reviewed in the Main Migration page in CloudForms
+
image::migration_running_15.png[Migration Running 15]

. Additionally the migration log can be downloaded and accessed post VM migration. This is useful for troubleshooting errors or just to check the migration details. It's worth mentioning that if the migration fails prior to the VM being migrated this log will not be available. To access the log navigate to Completed Plans, and click **Download Log** and then **Migration log** next to the desired VM.
+
image::migration_log_access.png[Migration Log Access]

.. Once the log is downloaded click to open:

+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, and having selected *Cluster01 (ticket-monster)* as the cluster to work with. We will start by mapping the network used by VMs to connect yto each other (i.e. JBoss EAP to the Database). We select *Source Network* as `vSphere\App-Internal-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\service` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6a.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* We will continue by mapping the network used by VMs to expose services to the internet(i.e. the Load Balancer exposing the Ticket Monster app). We select *Source Network* as `vSphere\App-DMZ-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\DMZ` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6b.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* Finally we can map the management network. To do so, select *Source Network* as `vSphere\Management Network` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\Admin` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

+
image::migration_plan_osp_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed during the migration. In the *pre-migration playbook service* we will select `migration-playbook-pre`, then select to use the *Pre-migration Service* for `lb` and click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_osp_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The `lb` has an specific network configuration in which the name of the interfaces in origin is diferent than in the destination. We will use this playbook to convert the configuration.

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Start migration inmediately*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_osp_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. In the *step 6* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan-app is in progress` shall appear. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_osp_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

. Back to the migration page we will see how the *Migration Plan* is already running
+
image::migration_plan_osp_8.png[Migration Plan 8]

. Once the migration is finished ...
+
image::migration_running_osp_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. We can find the instance in *OpenStack* in the *ticket-monster* project:
+
image::migration_running_osp_2.png[Migration Running 2]

== Running migrations using a CSV file

. Migrate the remaining application servers and database VMs from VMware to RHV using a CSV file.

.. Download the CSV sample file from link:../conf/ticket_monster_migration_sample.csv[here] and save it as `ticket_monster_migration_db.csv`. Check that the content is the following:
+
image:ticket_monster_csv_file.png[Multiple VM CSV File]
+
[TIP]
CSV file format is specified in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_infrastructure_migration_solution/1.1/html/infrastructure_migration_solution_guide/migrating_the_infrastructure#Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[Official Documentation]

.. This sample file could be an example of a CMDB dump after processing. We may remove the lines we know we are not going to use, leaving only the header row and the `db` row. link:../conf/ticket_monster_migration_db.csv[Sample here].
+
image:ticket_monster_csv_db_file.png[Multiple VM CSV File]
