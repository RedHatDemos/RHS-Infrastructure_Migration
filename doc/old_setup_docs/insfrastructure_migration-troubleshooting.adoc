== Red Hat Solutions: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration Troubleshooting

=== Accessing the environment

The environment can be accessed via ssh by connecting to the jump host or  `workstation-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com` using ssh SSH, your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1e37', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1e37.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* In the workstation there is a Proxy server (a.k.a. `squid`) that will use the internal DNS to work and reach all the internal machines. To use it, we can create an SSH tunnel that listens on `localhost` port `3128`
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key -L localhost:3128:localhost:3128 <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
+ 
[NOTE]
This will redirect the port 3128 in our laptop to the port 3128 in the workstation where `squid` is listening
+
Now by configuring the browser to access proxy in `localhost` port `3128` for all protocols, we will be running it as if it was directly inside the environment, consumin the internal DNS names.

All the names `*.example.com` are accesible now via browser:
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]

| Hostname | Internal IP | Description
|`workstation.example.com` |`192.168.0.10` | Jump host and Ansible host
|`storage.example.com` |`192.168.0.254` | NFS server
|`cf.example.com` |`192.168.0.100` |  CloudForms server
|`kvm0.example.com` |`192.168.0.40` | KVM hypervisor managed by Red Hat Virtualization
|`kvm1.example.com` |`192.168.0.41` | KVM hypervisor managed by Red Hat Virtualization
|`rhvm.example.com` |`192.168.0.35` | Red Hat Virtualization Manager server
|`esx1.example.com` |`192.168.0.51` | ESXi hypervisor
|`esx2.example.com` |`192.168.0.52` | ESXi hypervisor
|`vcenter.example.com` |`192.168.0.50` |VMware vCenter server
|=======

=== Administrative rights

* Your user is ready to become `root` using `sudo`:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

The user `root` in the `workstation` has a set of SSH keys exchanged with the rest of the machines in the environment.

Ansible is configured in the workstation to be able to easily execute commands in all machines (including VMs).

The Ansible hosts file `/etc/ansible/hosts` is as follows: 

----
[infra]
workstation.example.com
storage.example.com
cf.example.com
kvm0.example.com
kvm1.example.com
rhvm.example.com
vcenter.example.com

[app]
lb.example.com
jboss0.example.com
jboss1.example.com
db.example.com
----

An example is using ansible-console (and the password <to_be_provided> for vault) to check free space in root filesystem

----
[root@workstation-e8fb ~]# ansible-console infra
Vault password: 
Welcome to the ansible console.
Type help or ? to list commands.

=== Network Communication

* If network communication is severed between the source and target providers during migration, the migration will fail.  If the VM migration has begun import into the export domain in RHV, the faile dmigration will need to be cleaned up before attempting migration post failure.

* Management machines such as *CloudForms* and *RHV-Manager* are configured to use firewalld. You may get the list of open services and ports this way:

----
[root@rhvm-e8fb ~]# firewall-cmd --list-services
dhcpv6-client http ssh https
[root@rhvm-e8fb ~]# firewall-cmd --list-ports
6100/tcp
----

=== Logs 
. The conversion log is stored in /tmp on conversion host.
+
[NOTE]
On earlier conversion host configurations, logs can be found in /var/log/vdsm/import/
+
. On the MiQ/CloudForms appliance, logs are located under /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log

=== Processes
. Infrastructure Migration uses virt-v2v to perform VM migrations from source to target.  This process runs on the RHV conversion host and is part of virt-v2v-wrapper.py.  https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/blob/master/files/virt-v2v-wrapper.py

.. The launch of virt-v2v-wrapper.py is done through SSH, directly from CloudForms, using the net-ssh gem. The wrapper input is passed as standard input through the SSH channel and the output is collected. The wrapper immediately returns, so the SSH connection is short and less prone to network issues.

.. Currently, CloudForms leverages the host credentials, that have to be provided through the WebUI: Infrastructure > Hosts > Configuration > Edit this host. These credentials are used to initiate the SSH channel. We use the root user account, as it is required to run the wrapper.

=== Common Failures
. Incorrect infrastructure mappings
. RHV host credentials not set in MiQ/CloudForms
. Incorrect attributes for import .csv file

== Break Fix
=== Create an incorrect Infrastructure mapping for VMs to be migrated
. Review logs on the MiQ/CloudForms appliance 

=== Create an import from .csv file with the incorrect VM ID's
. Create a new migration plan with the incorrect .csv file
. Import the .csv and initiate the migration
.. Review logs on the MiQ/CloudForms appliance

=== Hard power off the source VM's to be migrated
. Initiate a VM migration
.. Review logs on the conversion host and MiQ/CloudForms appliance for failure
